    <h3>Let's understand the concepts of API calls</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>API (Application Programming Interface)</strong> is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Endpoint:</strong> A specific URL where an API can be accessed by a client application.</li>
        <li><strong>Request:</strong> The message sent by the client to the API, usually containing a method (GET, POST, etc.) and data.</li>
        <li><strong>Response:</strong> The data sent back by the API to the client, often in JSON format.</li>
        <li><strong>HTTP Methods:</strong> Common methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).</li>
    </ul>
