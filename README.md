# javascript-essentials 🚀

This repository contains my JavaScript learning journey with core concepts and projects, all organized as individual files in a single folder.

---

## 📚 What’s inside?

- JavaScript concept files covering basics and advanced topics:
  - Variables, data types, loops, functions, arrays, objects, and more.
- Mini projects and practice scripts like calculators, games, and utilities.

All files are directly inside this repo folder — no subfolders, making it easy to explore and run individual scripts.

---

## 🛠 How to Use

- Open any `.js` file in your code editor or IDE.
- Run or test the scripts using Node.js or inside your browser console (for browser-based code).
- Modify or experiment freely to enhance your understanding.
