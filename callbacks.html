    <h2>Lets learn call CallBacks</h2>
    <p>Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions. They allow you to execute a function after another function has completed its execution.</p>
    <p>Callbacks are often used in asynchronous programming, where you want to perform an action after a certain task has completed.</p>
    <p>For example, you might want to fetch data from a server and then process that data once it has been retrieved.</p>
